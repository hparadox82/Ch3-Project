/*
Write a program that can be used as a math tutor for a young student. The program
should display two random numbers to be added, such as 247+129.

The program should then pause while the student works on the problem. When the
student is ready to check the answer, he or she can press a key and the program
will display the correct solution: 247+129 = 376

Use the technique we talked about in class (using cin.get) to pause the screen.
Do NOT use system(pause).
